# URLEncoding for Arduino and ESP
This library provides URL encoding and decoding for Arduino, tested on Mega 2560 and ESP32. I'm sure its possible to do this more efficiently (without String), but I made this for another project and I have added it here because modularity is good.

# How to use
Download this repo as a zip, unzip it and then place in `Arduino/libraries`. Open/restart the Arduino IDE and an example should appear.
